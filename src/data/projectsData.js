    title: "TradeChain - Blockchain Trade Finance Solution",
    initialDescription: "Developed a blockchain-based trade finance solution using Hyperledger Fabric, streamlining processes for banks, applicants, and beneficiaries on a permissioned network. Live link unavailable due to the project's complex Hyperledger Fabric setup, relying on Docker and CLI for peers, orderers, and certificates. Hosting requires significant cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS VMs), making a public demo impractical. Check my GitHub repo or a Linkedin for details. Ideal for portfolio as a CLI-based, enterprise-grade blockchain solution.",
