## üîÑ Blog Automation via GitHub Actions

### How It Works

1. `fetch-devto-blogs.js` fetches latest blogs from Dev.to  
2. Writes them into `public/blogs.json`  
3. GitHub Actions runs this on a schedule or manual trigger  
4. Pushes updated `blogs.json` to repo  
5. Vercel auto-rebuilds with latest blog data  

### Workflow Snippet

```yaml
name: Fetch Dev.to Blogs

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 3 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update-blogs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm install
      - run: node fetch-devto-blogs.js
      - run: |
          git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git config user.email "41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git add public/blogs.json
          git commit -m "üîÑ Update blogs.json from Dev.to" || echo "No changes"
          git push
```
